# Connecting_two_microcontrollers_to_transfer_data.<br><br>
#### Connecting two Arduino microcontrollers to each other, in order to represent the idea of ​​"communication methods".<br>
#### We will connect the Arduino with another Arduino and then connect the button to one of them and the LED to the other. What will happen is: when we push the button on the first Arduino the LED on the second Arduino will light up.<br><br><br><br>
